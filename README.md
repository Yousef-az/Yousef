# Hello World! #
My name is Yousef Abuzaid and I'm a student studying AI and Computer Science. I have a fascination for using technology to solve problems and develop innovative solutions. As I continue to pursue my degree, I'm eager to apply what I've learned and gain hands-on experience in the field.

My skillset includes programming languages such as Python, Java, Swift, and C++, and I have a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and machine learning. I believe in creating clean and efficient code, and I'm constantly seeking to improve my abilities and expand my knowledge.

Take a look at my GitHub repository to see some of the projects I've been working on. I'm always open to collaboration and new opportunities, so don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in connecting!
